Whereas digital twins are receiving an increasing attention, their implementation has been predominated by monolithic and static solutions. A resulting issue is the lack of a modular integration and seamless interplay of digital twins when it comes to adapt and support varying industrial and societal applications. We address these challenges by leveraging on the OPC-UA standard to develop portable data connectors that move with and give access to the data source. Our Raspberry-Pi driven connector encapsulates a digital twin of the corresponding system and its offered services to capture the loose coupling and decentralization of systems and systems even remotely and in motion. This opens up new opportunities for different monitoring  modalities of large scale systems whose physical or/and virtual constituting subsystems are distributed across distinct geographical locations in the industrial and societal realm. We apply our framework to a mobile multi-arm robotic system and demonstrate the performance of its monitoring functionality from the cabin of a moving train. We provide experimental measurements results and highlight the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.
